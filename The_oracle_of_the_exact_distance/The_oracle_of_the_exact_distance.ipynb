    "### The oracle for the exact distance\n",
    "\n",
    "A common concept associated with search algorithms is that of an oracleâ€”an operator that changes the sign of the inputs that we are looking for. For example, let us label the possible inputs via the computational basis of the three-qubit states: $|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, \\ldots, |7\\rangle.$ Suppose that the sought-after element is $|3\\rangle$. Then the action of the oracle $U$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U|x\\rangle = |x\\rangle \\quad \\text{if}\\ x \\not = 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U|3\\rangle = -|3\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, oracles do not have to accept only one input, sometimes they accept more and will change sign to those that meet a certain property. \n",
    "We'll encounter an example of this in this challenge! Our goal will be to build an oracle capable of changing the sign of two three-qubit states **only when** these two states are separated by a distance $d$, as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/mn_oracle.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it may seem like a simple task, you may need some auxiliary qubits, so don't worry, you will be able to use them ðŸ˜‰ \n",
    "\n",
    "We will leave room at the top of the challenge template so that you can create as many helper functions as you want. \n",
    "However, the use of `qml.QubitUnitary` is not allowed. You must build this oracle without access to the circuit matrix, as would be done in a real quantum computer. "

    "## Challenge code\n",

    " The only function that must be completed is the quantum function `oracle_distance`, which takes as input the distance `d` (`int`), $d \\in \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\dots, 7\\}.$\n",
    " You can create as many helper functions as you want at the top of the challenge template. \n",
    " You can use up to 5 auxiliary qubits. Remember that the output state of the auxiliary qubits must be reset to $|0\\rangle$ after use. Otherwise, this could cause problems when implementing the operator in different algorithms. \n",
